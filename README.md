# Predicting-Customer-Churn-in-a-Telecommunications-Company
Assignment - Predicting Customer Churn in a Telecommunications Company
Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify
customers at risk of churning, enabling the company to take proactive measures to retain
them.
Tasks:
Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Dataset for the assignment: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telcocustomer-churn
Preprocessing the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare it for
analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Performing EDA on the dataset to understand customer behavior and factors influencing churn.
Visualize key findings using appropriate graphs and charts.
Feature Engineering:
Create relevant features that can help in predicting churn.
Building the Churn Prediction Model:
Choose and implement a machine learning algorithm for churn prediction. You can consider
algorithms like logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting, or any other suitable
models. Train and fine-tune the models using the dataset.
